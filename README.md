# Leaf-area-quantification
Quantification of the green and brown areas of leaves taken from images

This function uses images of leaves taken in the lab or field and calculates the green and brown areas of the leaf. Images intended for a common data set should all be taken from a fixed point with a consistent light source so that numbers will be consistent. Leaves should be placed on a white background and a blue square of known area should be placed in the picture. 

While this function may not replace more involved image analysis software, it has the advantage of working with the R environment, which may be familiar to many researchers from other parts of their analyses, and is faster than manual methods.
